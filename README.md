## Background

I built this app as part of my final year thesis. We were asked to build a web app that lists a series of questions and give them a score from 0 to 5 based on the degree of control. Then draw a radar chart from that data.

## Tools used

In order to build this app, I used nodeJS with express as a backend and React as a frontend. the database I used is mySQL. the radar chart was created thanks to [chartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/)
